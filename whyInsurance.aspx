            Why Insurance?</p></center>  
      
        <p style="font-size:20px">
            Have you ever had a moment — while looking at your insurance policy or shopping for insurance — when you’ve thought, “What is insurance? And do I really need it?”

You’re not alone.<br /><br />
            Insurance is tricky. It's not like buying a chair or a shirt or groceries. When you buy insurance, you're buying a promise. It's a promise that if something catastrophic happens to your business, your carrier is going to assist you to make your business whole again. Sometimes, though, it's tempting to question the value of insurance because it is an intangible product.

         <br /><br />
            Insurance is a financial safety net, helping you and your loved ones recover after something bad happens — such as a fire, theft, lawsuit or car accident. When you purchase insurance, you’ll receive an insurance policy, which is a legal contract between you and your insurance provider. And when you suffer a loss that’s covered by your policy and file a claim, insurance pays you or a designated recipient, called a beneficiary, based on the terms of your policy.
<br /><br />
The most difficult thing about insurance is that you’re paying for something you hope you never have to use. Nobody wants something bad to happen to them. But suffering a loss without insurance can put you in a difficult financial situation.
<br /><br /></p>
<p style="font-size:30px">Benefits of Insurance?</p><br />
        <p style="font-size:20px">
Insurance is an important financial tool. It can help you live life with fewer worries knowing you’ll receive financial assistance after a disaster or accident, helping you recover faster. When it comes to life insurance, this could mean your family doesn’t have to move out of the house or that your kids can afford to go to college. For auto insurance, it could mean you have extra cash in hand to help pay for repairs or a replacement vehicle after an accident. Insurance can help keep your life on track, as much as possible, after something bad derails it.

            <h3>1.) Insurance Keeps Commerce Moving</h3>
In the days after the 9/11 attacks, there were many worries about insurance coverage. Acts of war are not covered by insurance. Was terrorism an act of war? The big question was, How would the 9/11 attacks be classified? Fortunately, the insurance industry decided the attacks were not an act of war.

However, after 9/11, some insurers began excluding terrorism. But the federal government stepped in and required coverage in the name of keeping commerce moving. In this case, insurance likely prevented many businesses from avoiding terrorist-targeted operations, such as refineries and chemical haulers.

 <h3>2.) Lenders Require Insurance</h3>
This reason is tied to No. 1. Lenders require that you have insurance. Think about it: Mortgage lenders want proof of insurance before you buy or build a new building. In short, to get the money your business needs to keep going, it’s likely you enjoy the benefits of insurance. Without insurance, your winning business model can't get the funding it needs to take its first step, or your established business model can't get the funding to evolve and better compete.

 <h3>3.) Insurance is Compulsory in Some States</h3>
Insurance is important because sometimes it's the law! A great example of this is auto insurance. Auto insurance is compulsory in Wisconsin (home of HNI HQ). Auto insurance helps mitigate the risk of life on the road (of which there are many!). Workers' compensation is a form of compulsory insurance that's required in most states.

 <h3>4.) Insurance Grants Peace of Mind</h3>
Insurance, an intangible, provides another intangible: peace of mind. Business owners can take on certain business ventures because they can shift the risk — thanks to insurance. This reason is the counterpart to No. 2 — lenders require insurance. Insurance is the required (by lenders) safety net that lets entrepreneurs explore opportunity.

 <h3>5.) Insurance Ensures Family and Business Stability</h3>
Insurance is a safety net for when risks go wrong. Life insurance can support the life of a family, should a member be lost. It’s similar for a business. Should a key member or piece of equipment go out of commission, the business can carry on, thanks to insurance. This reason why insurance is important dovetails nicely with peace of mind (No. 4). It all goes back to the idea that insurance, when activated, makes policyholders whole again.

 <h3>6.) Insurance Protects the Small Guys</h3>
When you look at your industry, you see the "big guys" and the "small guys." If a risk goes wrong, the big guys will be able to survive. They can take a hit. But the little guys can't take a hit. As a result, they are more risk averse, and in some cases, they sell out to the big guys. If enough little guys leave the industry (and one big guy swallows them up), you're left with a monopoly. With insurance, however, the little guys have support if they want to take a risk, which means they stick around longer. What it comes down to is that insurance helps prevent monopolies from forming.

 <h3>7.) Insurance is the Right Thing to Do</h3>
A sobering example of insurance in action is the West Fertilizer Co. explosion in Texas this spring. The explosion did $100 million in damage to the community, including schools and hospitals. The fertilizer company had only $1 million in general liability coverage.

Now the city is suing West Fertilizer and likely will win all of the company’s remaining property and assets that were not damaged by the disaster. This is because the fertilizer company did not have enough insurance. What’s more is the city also is suing the suppliers to the fertilizer plant, claiming they knew they were supplying inherently dangerous materials. In the case of the West, Texas, plant explosion, insurance could have helped a community to recover after a crisis.

Insurance is something many business owners don't want to think about. But whether they think about insurance, with hope it's there, allowing for transfer of risk and providing a safety net for new opportunities. 

         <h2>  How does insurance work?</h2> 
Insurance is essentially a gigantic rainy day fund shared by many people (called policyholders) and managed by an insurance carrier. The insurance company uses money collected (called premium) from its policyholders and other investments to pay for its operations and to fulfill its promise to policyholders when they file a claim.

Because of the unpredictable nature of natural disasters — like tornadoes, hail, wildfires and hurricanes, and everyday disasters such as fender benders and kitchen fires — an insurance company’s main goal is to remain financially strong enough to handle anything that comes its policyholders’ way.

        <h1>Types of Insurance</h1>
        <p style="font-size:20px">
          <h2>a. Life Insurance</h2>  
If anyone depends on you financially, finding the best life insurance for your situation is essential. Life insurance is one way to replace your income if you die unexpectedly.

Life insurance policies usually fall into two main buckets: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.

<h4>Term life insurance</h4>
Term life insurance lets you lock in rates for a particular length of time, like 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. During this time, your premiums are level. Once the level term period ends, you can typically renew the policy on a yearly basis but at a higher cost each time.

If you want to cover a specific financial obligation, like the years of college or a debt, term life insurance may be a good fit for you. Term life insurance is usually the most affordable type of life insurance.

<h4>Permanent life insurance</h4>
Permanent life insurance can provide lifelong coverage. In addition to the death benefit, permanent life insurance includes a cash value component. If the cash value builds, you can access the money by taking a loan or withdrawing funds. If you decide to end the policy, you can take the cash value of the policy (minus any surrender charge).

Consider permanent life insurance if you want to build cash value to supplement retirement savings or to provide a death benefit for someone who will rely on you financially for a long period. Permanent life insurance is more expensive than term life insurance.

Types of permanent life insurance include whole life insurance, universal life insurance, variable life insurance and burial life insurance.


            <h2>b. Health Insurance</h2>

            Medical bills are one of the frequent causes of financial hardship in America, according to the American Public Health Association. Even if you’re young and healthy, a stay in the hospital could cost you about $30,000 for three days, according to Healthcare.gov. If you’re uninsured, that could wreck your finances.

            Health insurance or medical insurance is a type of insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses. As with other types of insurance, risk is shared among many individuals. By estimating the overall risk of health risk and health system expenses over the risk pool, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement.[1] The benefit is administered by a central organization, such as a government agency, private business, or not-for-profit entity.

According to the Health Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as "coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury. It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment
    
    <h2> c. Travel Insurance</h2>        

            Whether it’s a vacation of a lifetime or a cross-country trip for a cousin’s wedding, you may be wondering when or if it’s worthwhile to buy travel insurance. Probably the best answer is that it depends on what you can afford to lose. By understanding what travel insurance is and what it covers, you’ll be able to make the best decision on whether to buy it.
            <br /><br />
            Travel insurance is coverage designed to protect against risks and financial losses that could happen while traveling. The risks range from minor inconveniences such as missed airline connections and delayed luggage all the way to more serious issues including injuries or major illness.
            <br /><br />
            Depending on the coverage you choose, travel insurance can cover a broad array of possible damages and losses:
<br /><br /><br />
<b>Injury or sickness:</b><br />
Travel insurance can help protect you from medical expenses abroad that your normal health insurance doesn’t cover. Most health insurance plans don’t provide full coverage in foreign countries and some health plans provide no coverage at all, including Medicare. Travel insurance works in addition to your everyday health insurance and can help supplement medical costs if you get sick or injured before or during your vacation.
<br /><br />
<b>Lost luggage:</b><br />
Travel insurance can help cover expenses stemming from lost or stolen luggage. This is especially useful if an airline loses your bags, as it can be very difficult to get them to pay for lost luggage. 
            <br /><br />
<b>Last-minute cancellations:</b><br />
Travel insurance can help cover costs stemming from trip cancellations. Most resorts or cruise lines won’t give you a full refund in the event of a cancellation. If you cancel two weeks or more before your trip, most resorts will at least charge a cancellation fee; many cruise lines might only give you a 25% refund or will give you partial credit on another cruise. If you cancel within two weeks of a trip, with most companies you won’t give any refund whatsoever. 
<br /><br />
<b>Coverage beyond your credit card:</b><br />
Some credit cards provide limited coverage, with annual limits and restrictions for cancellations and interruptions. However, few credit cards offer coverage for the most expensive travel risks: medical expenses or emergency evacuations, which travel insurance can cover.
        

            <h2> d. Home Insurance</h2>

            Homeowners insurance covers damage to your home, property, personal belongings, and other assets in your home. Your homeowners insurance policy may also cover living expenses above your normal cost of living if a covered loss forces you to stay elsewhere while your home is being repaired or rebuilt. It may also provide coverage for accidents or injuries that occur in your home or on your property. A homeowners policy covers injuries you may unintentionally cause to others away from your property for which you may be liable.
           <br /><br /> Home insurance policies wrap up several types of coverage, including:<br />
<br />

<strong>Dwelling coverage:  </strong> From your roof to your floors, dwelling coverage protects the structure of your house from unexpected events like fire, wind, theft or vandalism. This type of coverage also pays to repair or replace structures attached to your property, such as a garage or deck. Your dwelling coverage amount should equal the cost of rebuilding your house.
<br /><br /><strong>Personal property coverage:  </strong> This type of coverage protects your personal belongings, such as furniture, appliances and clothing. Problems covered include theft, fire and explosions. Coverage for personal property is usually set at an amount between 50% and 70% of your dwelling coverage. You can usually buy more coverage if you need more.
<br /><br /><strong>Other structures on the property:  </strong> Structures on your property like a tool shed or fence are covered under this type of coverage.
<br /><br /><strong>Additional living expenses:  </strong> If you are temporarily displaced from your home because it’s been damaged by a problem covered by your policy, additional living expenses coverage pays extra costs such as for meals and lodging.
            <br /><br />
Remember that a standard home insurance policy doesn’t cover damage from floods or earthquakes, but separate insurance is available for these problems.


            <h2>e. Motor Insurance</h2>

            A motor insurance policy is a mandatory policy issued by an insurance company as part of prevention of public liability to protect the general public from any accident that might take place on the road. The law mandates that every owner of a motor vehicle must have one motor insurance policy


            <br /><br />

            You have to have motor insurance before you can drive your vehicle in a public place. It protects you, your vehicle and other motorists against liability in case there is an accident. It provides financial compensation to cover any injuries caused to people or their property.
            <h4> Types of Motor Insurance:</h4>
            <br />
    <strong>Liability coverage:</strong> 
 Liability insurance may help cover damages for injuries and property damage to others for which you become legally responsible resulting from a covered accident.
<br /><br />
 <strong>Collision insurance:</strong> 
Collision insurance may cover damage to your car after an accident involving another vehicle and may help to repair or replace a covered vehicle.
<br /><br />
 <strong>Comprehensive insurance:</strong> 
Comprehensive insurance can provide an extra level of coverage in the instance of an accident involving another vehicle. It may help pay for damage to your car due to incidents besides collisions, including vandalism, certain weather events and accidents with animals.
     <br />

            <h2>f. Miscellaneous Insurance</h2>

            Miscellaneous Insurance refers to contracts of insurance other than those of Life, Fire and Marine insurance. It covers a variety of risks, the chief of which are:- Personal Accident insurance.

            Look, mistakes happen. Whether we admit it or not, we all make them.But what happens when you make a big mistake? Like, lawsuit-big.

Maybe you’re an accountant who missed a few numbers and all of the sudden your client is out millions? Maybe your agency promised big results but failed to deliver? Clients can file lawsuits against your business for mistakes like these, even when you don’t deserve it.

Without the right insurance, you’ll be responsible for covering attorney, litigation and even settlement fees out of pocket. On the other hand, if you have a good Miscellaneous insurance policy, you won’t have to shoulder the crushing weight of that financial burden.
